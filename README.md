## **Abstract**  
This paper investigates an **Intelligent Reflective Surface (IRS)**-assisted secure multi-user two-way communication system. The focus is on enhancing **physical layer security** by optimizing the **minimum secrecy-rate** among all user pairs in the presence of a malicious user. The main contributions are as follows:

- **Optimization Problem:** Converted into an alternating optimization problem consisting of two sub-problems:
  - **Transmit Power Optimization:** Solved using **Fractional Programming (FP)**.
  - **IRS Phase Shift Optimization:** Solved using **Semi-Definite Programming (SDP)**.

- **Convergence Analysis:** Convergence of the proposed algorithm is numerically investigated.
- **Performance Analysis:** Quantified performance gain for four different user configurations compared to a baseline scheme. The results show a **3.6-fold improvement** in minimum secrecy rate when the IRS is optimally positioned near a legitimate user, even when the malicious user is close by.
